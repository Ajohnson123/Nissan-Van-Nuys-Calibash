                  <p style="text-align: center;">STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
                  <p>
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>These rules apply to all contests conducted by Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. radio stations and websites. Station-specific and website-specific contests may have their own specific rules which will be set forth in the Official Contest Rules for that particular contest and will be available at the Station studio and/or posted on the applicable website. If there is a conflict between the Official Contest Rules and the General Contest Rules/Standard Terms and Conditions, the Official Contest Rules shall control.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>1. HOW TO ENTER AND PLAY</p>
                  <p>Unless otherwise noted, one entry per person will be accepted. In the event multiple entries are allowed, each entry must be submitted individually. Mechanically reproduced or software generated entries of any kind will not be accepted. Any materials submitted become the property of Station/Website and will not be returned.</p>
                  <p>2. ELIGIBILITY RESTRICTIONS</p>
                  <p>Unless otherwise specified, contests are open to all listeners who are 18 years of age or older and who reside in the service area of Station/Website. Contestants must possess a valid, government-issued ID. Winner must show proof of residency to verify eligibility.</p>
                  <p>Employees of Station/Website, its licensee, its parent corporation and their affiliated entities, advertising and PR agencies, participating sponsors/promotional partners, other radio stations in the service area of the Station/Website and the members of their immediate families are ineligible to participate or win.</p>
                  <p>Unless otherwise specified, Listeners are eligible to win contests conducted by Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. and its affiliates only once every sixty (60) days and a prize valued at $600 or more, only once every six months. Only one winner per household (whether related or not) is permitted in any contest.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>3. PRIZES</p>
                  <p>Unless otherwise specified by the Station/Website, all prizes or prize certificates must be claimed at the office of the Station/Website conducting the contest, Monday-Friday, during regular business hours. Prize or prize certificate must be claimed within thirty (30) days of winning. Failure to claim prize by the specified time will result in forfeiture of the prize.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Unless otherwise permitted by the Station/Website, winner(s) must claim his or her Prize in person, and a Prize cannot be claimed by third parties on behalf of the winner. If a contest is open to entrants under the age of 18 and a winner is under the age of 18, a parent or legal guardian must claim the Prize. It is the winner’s sole responsibility to claim the Prize or prize certificate within the timeline provided in the official rules of the contest.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>In the event that a prize or prize certificate is mailed to the winner, it will be with the prior written consent of the winner and therefore, winner assumes the risk of its arrival. The Station/Website is not responsible for the safe arrival of a prize or prize certificate.</p>
                  <p>Prizes are not transferable. Prizes may not be substituted for or redeemed for cash.</p>
                  <p>4. SELECTION OF WINNERS</p>
                  <p>Contest winners will be selected and notified of their prize in the manner announced by the Station/Website.</p>
                  <p>Unless otherwise specified, if the winner(s) cannot be contacted within 24 hours after the prize is awarded, an alternate winner may be selected at the Station/Website’s discretion. Unless otherwise specified, winners who fail to respond within 24 hours of prize notification are deemed to be waiving their prize claim and the prize will be forfeited.</p>
                  <p>The odds of winning depend upon the number of eligible entries received or the relative performance of each contestant.</p>
                  <p>5. CONDITIONS</p>
                  <p>WARNING: Online listeners to streamed broadcasts may experience a lag in transmissions.</p>
                  <p>Taxes and Liability: Payment of all federal, state and local taxes is the sole responsibility of the winner. Contest winnings will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and winners can expect to receive a 1099 tax form for prizes which total more than $600 for the calendar year. Winners may be required to accurately complete and submit IRS Form W-9 to the Station/Website as a condition of acceptance of a prize.</p>
                  <p>By participating in the contest, contestant agrees to have his or her name, voice, or likeness used in any advertising or broadcasting material relating to this contest without additional financial or other compensation.</p>
                  <p>By participating in the contest, contestants hereby releases and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Station/Website, its licensee, affiliates, subsidiaries, parent corporation and each of their officers, directors, shareholders, employees, advertising and PR agencies, sponsors, advertisers, promotional partners, agents, representatives, and their successors and assigns, and all others connected with them and the contest (collectively, “Released Parties”) from any and all liability, claims, actions and damages sustained or incurred by participation in the contest and the receipt and use of any prize awarded (if any) through such contest arising in any manner whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Contest winners (and their guests or travel companions, if any) may be required in the Station/Website’s sole discretion, to sign a liability release and a publicity release. A winner (or his/her parent or legal guardian if under the age of 18 years) must execute and return any required release within five (5) business days from notification or winner will be disqualified and the prize will be forfeited. An alternate winner may be chosen by random selection. Pursuant to the liability release, the winners will agree to hold the Released Parties harmless against any and all claims or liability arising directly or indirectly from the prize or participation in the contest. Any contestant (or his/her parent or legal guardian, if applicable) who refuses to sign any required release will forfeit any and all prizes.</p>
                  <p>The Station/Website will be excused from its obligation to conduct the contest if its performance is delayed or prevented due to causes beyond its control, including, but not limited to acts of God, public enemies, war, civil disorder, fire, flood, hurricanes, explosion, labor disputes or strikes, and any acts by any governmental authority.</p>
